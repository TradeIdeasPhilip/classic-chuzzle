I like Classic Chuzzle but I want to fix a few things.
I don't have their source code so I have to start from scratch.

This is a nice example of the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API)
I wish I'd learned about that much sooner.
It's a way to do animations with only JavaScript.
No CSS.
