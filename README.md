# Classic Chuzzle
## Status
Very early, but playable.
## How to Play
Try it yourself:  https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/classic-chuzzle/.

Drag a cell until you have a group of 3 or more cells of the same color touching.
Those will disappear and be replaced with new cells.
## Why?
I like Classic Chuzzle but I want to fix a few things.
I don't have their source code so I have to start from scratch.
## Interesting Tech
This is a nice example of the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API).
I wish I'd learned about that much sooner.
It's a way to do animations with only JavaScript.
No CSS.
